FAXC: A Fast and Accurate XGBoost Classifier Based on Shapelet Features for Time Series Classification

In the recent decades, time series classification (TSC) has attracted significant interest. Among the TSC methods, shapelet based methods are promising because they are interpretable, more accurate, and faster than other methods. However, there are still two challenges for shapelet based methods. First, the training time of shapelet based methods is high. Second, the accuracy rates of the classifiers which combine with shapelet features at present are not ideal. To address these problems, a fast and accurate XGBoost classifier (FAXC) based on shapelet features for TSC is proposed in this work. In FAXC, there are two acceleration strategies to reduce the training time: time series sampling and subsequence filter. Through these two strategies, the number of shapelet candidates is greatly reduced, which leads to an obvious reduction in training time. Unlike other methods which accelerate shapelet selection process at the expense of reducing accuracy, an XGBoost classifier based on shapelet features is used in FAXC to improve classification accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that FAXC is faster than the state-of-the-art classifiers, and the classification accuracy of FAXC is also improved to a certain extent.
